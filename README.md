In a given set of mushrooms which one is safe and edible and which ones are poisonous.

Methodology:
1) Collecting data from Kaggle
2) Cleaning the data.
3) EDA and data manipulation.
4) Preparing Data for Machine Learning
5) Classification Methods:
                         
 6) Checking Classification Results with Confusion Matrix.
 7) Conclusion.
                         
Basically creating a machine learning algorythm which detects any mushroom is edible or poisinous due to it's specifications like cap shape-color or gill color-size.
